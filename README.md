You need Ren'Py 8.0.3 to compile. All changes here will be considered for the full paid release.

Violet and Amber are already more or less complete in the game, so adding content to those will not yield any results.

Bug fixes or code improvements you contribute will be added to the paid release and will be under our copyright. Anything else you contribute to this repo will remain here for others to modify and is considered public domain.
